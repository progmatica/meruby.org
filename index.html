      The Sinatra web microframework<br />
      -Nick Plante<br />
      <br />
      Local Ruby hero <a href="http://blog.zerosum.org/">Nick Plante</a> will deliver a 
      practical introduction to Sinatra, the Ruby web microframework:<br />
      <br />
      Sinatra provides a domain specific language (DSL) for creating RESTful Ruby-based 
      web applications. If you’re used to Rails’heavyweight approach to MVC, and think that 
      it’s overkill for a certain class of minimalist web properties, you might be right. 
      This is the sort of thing that Sinatra truly excels at, being lightweight and truly 
      tiny. It’s also ORM agnostic and easy to manipulate, allowing developers to choose 
      the tools that best suit them and their application. Standalone web service APIs, 
      widgets, and micro-applications are all examples of things for which Sinatra might be a great fit.<br />
      <br />
      In this presentation, Nick will give you a basic overview of the syntax you need to 
      create useful Sinatra web apps, and will demonstrate how it can be used to create a 
      Twitter-based keyword aggregator like <a href="http://nhruby.org/tweetdreams.org">Tweetdreams</a> quickly and easily.

      TYFBO: Test Your Brains Out<br />
      -Casey Rosenthal<br />
      <br />
      Old Man Rosenthal will get some discussion going about rspec, building on the preceding
      Sinatra presentation.  You will find out why the cool kids test their code, and why 
      you should be mortified if you don't subscribe to TDD or BDD.<br />
      <br />
      If fear doesn't inspire you, then Rosenthal will switch gears to talk about SASS, 
      building on Ted Roche's <a href="http://www.tedroche.com/Present/2009/css/css.html">CSS
      presentation</a> in New Hampshire a while back.<br />
      <br />
      There will be a surprise appearance at this presentation, so expect to be surprised. 
      You will learn things you didn't know that you wanted to know, some things you don't
      want to know now that you do, and you may even unlearn some things that you didn't know to check whether
      you wanted to know in the first place.  It's all about TDD, after all.
